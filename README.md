# Professional Software Engineering Portfolio

 My goal with this project was to familiarize myself with the React library in addition to understanding project scaffolding and architecture. I wanted to build something lightweight and flexible all while showcasing my work.

## Key features

* Webpack configuration for development (with hot reloading) and production (with minification).
* CSS module loading
* Both js(x) and css hot loaded during development.
* Filesystem routing

## Build Setup

```
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).

## Unit testing

Opted not to add unit testing since this is a small scale project not built for production. I may decide to integrate Mocha, Chai at a later date.


## Built With

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html) - The web framework used
* [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) - Framework for server-rendered React apps
* [Material-UI]("http://www.material-ui.com/#/") - React Components that implement Google's Material Design.
* [React-Motion]("https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion") - Framework for animating React Components.
